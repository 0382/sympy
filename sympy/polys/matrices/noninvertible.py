def invertible_supplement(M):
    r"""
    Append carefully chosen columns to *M* to make a square invertible matrix.

    Explanation
    ===========

    Given an $n \times r$ matrix *M* of rank $r$ (so $r \leq n$), this function
    computes an invertible $n \times n$ matrix $B$ such that the first $r$
    columns of $B$ equal *M*.

    This operation can be interpreted as a way of extending a basis for a
    subspace, to give a basis for the whole space.

    To be precise, suppose you have an $n$-dimensional vector space $V$, with
    basis $\{v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n\}, and an $r$-dimensional subspace $W$ of
    $V$, spanned by a basis $\{w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_r\}$, where the $w_j$ are
    given as linear combinations of the $v_i$. If the columns of *M* represent
    the $w_j$ as such linear combinations, then the columns of the matrix $B$
    computed by this function give a new basis $\{u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_n\}$ for
    $V$, again relative to the $\{v_i\}$ basis, and such that $u_j = w_j$
    for $1 \leq j \leq r$.

    Parameters
    ==========

    M: DomainMatrix

    Returns
    =======

    DomainMatrix
        This DomainMatrix is invertible and its first r columns equal M.

    Raises
    ======

    DMRankError if M was not of maximal rank
