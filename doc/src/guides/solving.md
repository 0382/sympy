# Solve Using the SymPy Python Library

The Python package SymPy can symbolically solve equations, differential equations, 
linear equations, nonlinear equations, matrix problems, inequalities, 
diophantine equations, and evaluate integrals. SymPy can also solve numerically.

Note: SymPy has a function called 
[`solve`](https://docs.sympy.org/dev/modules/solvers/solvers.html?highlight=solve#sympy.solvers.solvers.solve) 
which is designed to find the roots of an equation or system of equations. 
SymPy `solve` may or may not be what you need for a particular problem, 
so we recommend you use the links on this page to learn how to "solve" your problem.
