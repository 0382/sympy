# Glossary

This page is a glossary for various terms used throughout the SymPy
documentation. This glossary is primarily for terms that are specific to
SymPy. For more general Python terms, refer to the [Python
glossary](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html). Mathematical terms are
only included here if they have a specific meaning in SymPy. For general
mathematical definitions, refer to other sources such as
[Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) or
[MathWorld](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/), as well as the references in the
documentation for the specific SymPy functions.

<!-- Please follow the following style for the glossary:

- Capitalize the names, unless they refer to code.
- Each definition should be short (no more than a paragraph).
- Keep the definitions in alphabetical order.
- Use cross-references to refer to full documentation for functions, etc.
- Classes/functions should only be listed here if they are core concepts for
  understanding how to use SymPy. Classes and functions themselves can be
  documented in their respective docstrings in the modules reference.

<!-- To cross reference a glossary item elsewhere in the documentation use
{term}`termname` in Markdown or :term:`termname` in RST. -->
